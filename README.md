# PollScroller
This is an application meant to eventually allow one to create a voting system based on reoccurring votes. 
By that I mean that you vote on a poll one day then vote on it again the next. 
The theory is that the voters that care more will vote more frequently. 

Contained in this Git Repository is the ./src file of my Poll Viewing website using the Angular 6 application.

1. To run the repository, have Angular 6+ installed on your computer. 
2. Create a generic project: 
  ng new <insert-name>
3. Replace the default ./src file with the one contained in this repository. 
4. Install all of the dependencies required for the project: 
  npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
  npm install --save font-awesome angular-font-awesome
  npm install ngx-drag-scroll --save
  npm install --save ng-sidebar
  npm install hammerjs --save
